## About the Project

**Work Day Scheduler** is Homework 5 for UW Coding Bootcamp. We were given a [User Story](https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/uw-sea-fsf-pt-08-2020-u-c/tree/master/class-content/05-Third-Party-APIs/02-Homework#user-story) and [Acceptance Criteria](https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/uw-sea-fsf-pt-08-2020-u-c/tree/master/class-content/05-Third-Party-APIs/02-Homework#acceptance-criteria) to follow.  
We were provided with the index.html and style.css files to start with. Our goal was to create a dynamic day planner for a single work day using the Moment.js library.

For this project, I focused on learning to read API documentation to learn how to utilize and implement the code in the library. I read through the moment.js documentation and this helped me to form my pseudocode structure. I also focused on using jQuery in my functions and to navigate the DOM when initializing my variables.

### Built With

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)  
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

## Usage

To use the Work Day Scheduler, enter event or appointment information on the appropriate time block and click the save button to the right. This info will be stored in local storage and display on refresh, until it is changed and saved in line or deleted from local storage. The background color of the time blocks will update with the current time. Gray represents past events, red current events, and green future events. When the date changes, the current date will display at the top of the page, but the events will remain until manually deleted or changed.
